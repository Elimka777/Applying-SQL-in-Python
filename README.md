1. Gym Database Management with Python and SQL - The database, fitness_center_db, includes 'Members' and 'WorkoutSessions' tables. I developed various functions to add, retrieve, update, and delete records in these tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient data handling.
2. Advanced Data Analysis in Gym Management System -As a member of the gym's management team, I performed a thorough analysis of the membership data. I created Python functions to execute advanced SQL queries for identifying distinct departments, counting employees in each department, and filtering employees based on age.
